no later than 55,000 years ago.[26][27][28] Their long occupation
, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers,
 has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in 
 human genetic diversity.[29] Settled life emerged on the 
 subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river
